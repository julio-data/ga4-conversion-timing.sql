Conversion Time Analysis in GA4 with BigQuery
This repository contains advanced SQL queries to measure and analyze the time it takes users to convert—from their first session to their first purchase—using GA4 export data in BigQuery.

The queries include:

conversion_time_by_user.sql: Calculates time to convert per user.

conversion_time_by_channel.sql: Aggregates average conversion time by traffic source.

conversion_time_by_day_with_segmentation.sql: Tracks daily average conversion time and segments days by performance vs. selected range and overall dataset.

All queries are optimized for dashboards (e.g., Looker Studio) and scalable for cohort or campaign-level analysis.
